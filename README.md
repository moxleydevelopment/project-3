# Dance Life

### Intro:
Web application that uses the mern stack to create an experience that will allow a user to register their dance studio, classes and the 
instructors that lead those classes. Within a studio users can add the information that their respective studio offers. There are also videos with the type of choreoagraphy so that potential students can see the types of dances they can look forward tp learning.

## Application Structure
The app uses two models, one is the actual dance studio, and the other would be the classes that each studio will hold.
Dance stuios may contain either zero dance classes or many classes.
